The *Menu Switch* node outputs one of its inputs depending on a menu
selection. Only the input that is passed through the node is computed.

The available menu entries are defined by the user. Menu items can be
added and removed, as well as renamed and reordered in the editor side
bar. Renaming a menu entry keeps existing links of the matching input
socket.

The menu can be used in node groups and the nodes modifier UI.
Connecting the menu input with a *Group Input* node will expose the menu
as a group input. A menu socket in a node group, reroute node, or other
pass-through nodes needs to be connected to a *Menu Switch* node in
order to work. An unconnected menu socket will show an empty menu by
default.

Connecting multiple *Menu Switch* nodes to the same output
socket creates a conflict (even when the menu entries are the same).
To avoid this a menu switch can be wrapped in a node group. Multiple
node groups of the same type can be connected to the same menu, since
they contain the same menu switch node.

          Conflict caused by connecting different menus.

          Same node group can be connected without conflict.
