.. _bpy.types.SpaceClipEditor.lock_selection:
.. _bpy.ops.clip.lock_selection_toggle:

Toggle Lock Selection :kbd:`L`
   Automatically pans the view to follow the selected markers,
   so that they remain in the same location on screen during tracking and playback.

   This option "locks the view onto the selection" and is not to be confused with the

   which instead prevents you from changing the active marker.
