Gizmos
======

Next to the Sidebar region at the top, there are gizmos that allow panning
and zooming more comfortably when e.g. no mouse wheel is available.


View Menu
=========

Region Controls
   Adjust which regions are visible in the Image editor.
Update Automatically
   Instantly update any other editors that are affected by changes in this Image Editor.
   When disabled, the other editors may display outdated information until they're manually refreshed
   (e.g. by orbiting for the 3D Viewport).
Show Metadata
   Displays metadata about the selected Render Result. See the Output tab's
   :doc:`/render/output/properties/metadata` panel to change what metadata to include.
Display Texture Paint UVs
   Toggles UVs in Paint Mode. The object must be in Texture Paint Mode or Edit Mode for the UVs to be visible.

Zoom
   Menu with convenient zoom levels and operations.
   The zoom levels are calculated based on the images resolution compared to the screen resolution.

   - 12.5% (1:8) :kbd:`Numpad8` zoom out to a factor of 12.5%.
   - 25% (1:4) :kbd:`Numpad4` zoom out to a factor of 25%.
   - 50% (1:2) :kbd:`Numpad2` zoom out to a factor of 50%.
   - 100% (1:1) :kbd:`Numpad1` resets the zoom to 100%.
   - 200% (2:1) :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad2` zoom in to a factor of 200%.
   - 400% (4:1) :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad4` zoom in to a factor of 400%.
   - 800% (8:1) :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad8` zoom in to a factor of 800%.

   Zoom In/Out :kbd:`Wheel`
      Zooms the view in or out.
   Zoom to Fit :kbd:`Shift-Home`
      Like *Frame All*, but uses as much space in the editor as possible.
   Zoom Region :kbd:`Shift-B`
      Zoom in the view to the nearest item contained in the border.
Frame All :kbd:`Home`

Clear Render Region :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-B`

Render Slot Cycle Next/Previous :kbd:`J`/:kbd:`Alt-J`
