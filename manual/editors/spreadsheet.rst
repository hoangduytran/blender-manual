Spreadsheet
***********

The Spreadsheet editor is used to inspect the geometry attributes of the :term:`active` object,
typically in order to debug :doc:`geometry nodes </modeling/geometry_nodes/introduction>`.

   The Spreadsheet editor.


Header
======

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet.show_only_selected:

Show Only Selected
   This option is only available if the object is in Edit Mode.
   When checked, only data for the selected geometry elements is shown.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet.use_filter:

Use Filter
   Whether to use the filters that are defined in the Sidebar (see below).


Main Region
===========

The main region displays the attribute data in a spreadsheet format.
Each column corresponds to an attribute or data property,
and each row represents an element such as a vertex, face, spline, or instance.

Column names and row indices remain visible while scrolling both vertically and horizontally.

.. _bpy.ops.spreadsheet.resize_column:
.. _bpy.ops.spreadsheet.fit_column:
.. _bpy.ops.spreadsheet.reorder_columns:

- Columns can be resized by clicking and dragging the vertical line between columns.
- Double clicking the vertical line automatically sizes the column to fit the content.
- Columns can be reordered by clicking and dragging the column header.

.. note::

   Tooltips give more detail about the value, depending on the :ref:`type <attribute-data-types>`.
   For example, *Byte Color* attributes are displayed as scene linear floats,
   but the actual integer values are displayed when hovering over the float values,
   and *Matrix* attribute values are only displayed in tooltips.


View Menu
---------

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet.show_region_toolbar:

Toolbar :kbd:`T`
   Show or hide the tab panel on the left for creating and manipulating markers and masks.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet.show_region_ui:

Sidebar :kbd:`N`
   Show or hide the :ref:`Sidebar <ui-region-sidebar>`.

----------

Area
   Area controls. See the :doc:`user interface </interface/window_system/areas>`
   documentation for more information.


Data Set Region
===============

Located on the left, this region controls which data is displayed in the spreadsheet.


Context Path
------------

Displays the active object name in the panel header.

Clicking one of the arrows between the names to hide the modifier.

.. _bpy.ops.spreadsheet.toggle_pin:

Clicking the :bl-icon:`unpinned` icon locks the Spreadsheet editor to the currently active object and data path,
keeping it visible even if you select another object. Click again to unlock.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet.object_eval_state:

Object Evaluation State
   Defines which state of the object's data is displayed:

   :Evaluated: Shows data with all modifiers applied.
   :Original: Shows the original object data, without modifiers.
   :Viewer Node: Displays data from the active :doc:`Viewer Node </modeling/geometry_nodes/output/viewer>` in Geometry Nodes.

   You can also toggle between *Evaluated* and *Viewer Node* by clicking the
   :bl-icon:`restrict_view_off` / :bl-icon:`restrict_view_on` icon in the Viewer node's header.


Viewer Path
^^^^^^^^^^^

Visible when *Object Evaluation State* is set to *Viewer Node*.

Shows the path from the modifier to the active viewer node.
If the viewer node is nested inside group nodes, each group will appear in the path.


.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet.geometry_component_type:

Geometry
--------

Lets you browse nested geometries (e.g., a mesh inside an instance or a geometry collection).


.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet.attribute_domain:

Domain
------

Lets you choose the attribute domain to display, such as mesh vertices or curve splines.

The number of elements in each domain is shown next to its entry.


Sidebar
=======

.. _bpy.ops.spreadsheet.add_row_filter_rule:

In the Sidebar, you can define filters so that only the rows matching these filters
are displayed. Click *Add Row Filter* and set up the properties described below.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheetRowFilter.enabled:

Enabled
   Uncheck to temporarily disable the filter.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheetRowFilter.column_name:

Column
   The name of the column to filter on. If there is no column with the specified name,
   the filter will be grayed out and ignored.

   If you want to filter on an attribute from another domain, you can use the
   :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/attribute/store_named_attribute` to create a copy
   that's converted to the current domain, then filter on that.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheetRowFilter.operation:

Operation
   For numerical columns, you can select one of the following comparison operators.
   Other columns only support *Equal To*.

   :Equal To: Only display rows whose value for the column is equal to the filter value
      (within the specified threshold).
   :Greater Than: Only display rows whose value for the column is greater than the filter value.
   :Less Than: Only display rows whose value for the column is less than the filter value.

Value
   The filter value to compare the row value to.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheetRowFilter.threshold:

Threshold
   How much the row's value is allowed to deviate from the filter value before it is excluded.


Status Bar
==========

The status bar shows how many rows and columns there are, and how many rows remain after filtering.
